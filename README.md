Statistical &amp; ML analysis of PLFS (Periodic Labor Force Survey) unit-level data to Unveil India’s labor patterns
# 📊 Unveiling Employment and Socioeconomic Patterns – PLFS Analysis

This repository contains the complete analysis and report of my internship project conducted at the **Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)** under the **National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), Field Operations Division (FOD), Jaipur**.

🧠 The project focuses on deriving insights from **Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)** unit-level data to explore employment patterns, education profiles, age distribution, and socioeconomic indicators across Indian states and demographic groups.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze employment status across different education levels, age groups, and genders.
- Explore household and regional variations using statistical techniques.
- Use **Python** and **Tableau** to extract, clean, visualize, and model the PLFS data.
- Apply **machine learning** for employment prediction and **clustering** for segmentation.

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Extraction**: Converted fixed-width PLFS files into structured format using Python.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, format inconsistencies, encoding issues, and duplicates.
3. **Data Integration**: Merged household and person-level data.
4. **EDA**: Explored distributions, trends, and demographic breakdowns.
5. **Correlation & Trend Analysis**: Investigated relationships between employment, education, and region.
6. **Clustering**: Applied **K-Means** to segment states based on employment-literacy patterns.
7. **Model Fitting**: Used **Logistic Regression** to predict employment status from education and demographics.
8. **Visualization**: Developed static (Python) and interactive (Tableau) plots for effective communication.

## 📈 Key Outcomes

- **Regular wage/salary earning** was the most common employment type (≈45%), followed by **self-employment** (≈32%).
- **Education-employment link**: Individuals with higher education were more likely to be in salaried jobs, but not exclusively.
- **Age-wise expenditure trends**: Expenditure peaked at ages 35–45 and declined thereafter.
- **No statistically significant association** was found between education and employment in chi-square testing.
- **Clustering** revealed distinct state-level groupings by employment and literacy.
- **Model performance**:
  - Logistic Regression accuracy: **75%**
  - Highlighted class imbalance in prediction results.
